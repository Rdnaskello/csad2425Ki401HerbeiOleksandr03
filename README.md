# Tic-Tac-Toe game using Arduino and SFML with UART communication.

## Details about Repository
This repository contains the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses a client-server architecture. The client is a graphical user interface built with SFML, while the server runs on an Arduino board, communicating with the client through UART.
